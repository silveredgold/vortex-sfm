Since 0.1.0 the extension has been updated to use mod types (a feature in Vortex) to allow installing different mods to different locations with the same extension.
If you were previously using the Alternate variant of SFM for Vortex, install the latest version of the extension and change the default install mode in the Mods tab of your Vortex settings to &amp;lsquo;Isolated&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Automated Installation</title><link>/installation/automatic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/installation/automatic/</guid><description>This is the easiest way to get started and you should only install manually if this doesn't work! Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find SFM Support and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted. Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Source Filmmaker (SFM) in your Games screen and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to install some mods!</description></item><item><title>Install from Archive</title><link>/installation/archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/installation/archive/</guid><description>If Vortex fails to install the extension for some reason, you can also download and install an archive of the extension files.
Downloading from Nexus Mods To download the extension files, click the Manual Download on the Mod page on Nexus Mods to download the archive.
Downloading from GitHub Download the latest files from the GitHub Releases page. You can also download the latest CI builds from Actions, but these are rebuilt on each commit and may not be as stable as those available on Nexus Mods.</description></item><item><title>Manual</title><link>/installation/manual/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/installation/manual/</guid><description>Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade. If you don’t want to enable Advanced Mode for Vortex or want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.
First, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named game-sourcefilmmaker with three files inside:</description></item><item><title>Install Modes</title><link>/usage/install-modes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/usage/install-modes/</guid><description>Before you get to installing your favourite mod files, there&amp;rsquo;s one more thing you should know about: install modes.
Install modes were introduced in 0.1.0 and allow you to control how and where mods are installed and how they interact with SFM.
Merged mode Merged mode is the default install mode for new mods and will install your mods merged into a single vortex folder in your SFM directory, so SFM will see them as one mod with a lot of assets.</description></item><item><title>Installing Mods</title><link>/usage/installing-mods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/usage/installing-mods/</guid><description>Now that Vortex is fully set up, download any mods you want to install. Mod files should be the original mod archive files (*.rar, *.zip, *.7z etc).
Open the Mods screen from the Vortex sidebar and drag-and-drop the archive files into Vortex to add them to your list. You will then need to install them and enable them as per the usual Vortex installation process.
Once you Enable a mod, its files will be installed into SFM’s install directly automatically.</description></item><item><title>Search Paths</title><link>/usage/search-paths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/usage/search-paths/</guid><description>As with any mod installed for SFM, whether manually or using SFM for Vortex, you will need to tell SFM about your new mod. You can do this manually or try the experimental auto-update.
Manual Method You need to enable the search paths for Vortex mods just like you would any other mod you have installed. Open the SFM SDK, by clicking Launch in your Steam library and selecting “Launch SDK” when prompted.</description></item><item><title>Support</title><link>/support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/support/</guid><description>This is just a community-backed open-source project, not an officially-supported Vortex component. As such, support is best-effort.
To report a problem or request a new feature, create a new issue on the GitHub repository and provide as much detail as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
