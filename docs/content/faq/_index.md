Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions about SFM for Vortex.

#### What happened to the different extension versions?

They're not needed anymore! Thanks to the help of another Nexus/Vortex community member, I've been able to refactor things to no longer need multiple versions.

#### Why do I need Vortex for this?

Rather than reimplement all of Vortex’s functionality or introduce any number of new and exciting bugs that might break your SFM install, using Vortex lets us make the most of a reasonably reliable source of consistent and reversible mod installation tooling while tuning it to match the SFM way.

#### Why not just use Steam Workshop?

You should! If the mod you want is available on the Workshop, use it from there! Steam and SFM already include a lot of very reliable tooling around managing SFM mods and you should make the most of that if you can. SFM for Vortex is here for mods that aren’t available on the Workshop.

#### I’m a mod author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex?

They probably already are! If you want to maximise support and avoid some issues, pack your mod archive in such a way that the `materials/models/maps/sound/scripts` directories are at the root of the archive, and that’s basically it.

#### Why can’t I download mods from the Nexus?

Nexus Mods doesn’t currently support SFM, so you will not be able to download mods from the Nexus website. If the day comes when Nexus starts supporting SFM (pretty unlikely, I know) most of the Nexus/Vortex integration features (including the one-click downloads) should just work out of the box.
