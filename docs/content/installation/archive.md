If Vortex fails to install the extension for some reason, you can also download and install an archive of the extension files.

### Downloading from Nexus Mods

To download the extension files, click the Manual Download on the [Mod page on Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/64) to download the archive.

### Downloading from GitHub

Download the latest files from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/silveredgold/vortex-sfm/releases). You can also download the latest CI builds [from Actions](https://github.com/silveredgold/vortex-sfm/actions), but these are rebuilt on each commit and may not be as stable as those available on Nexus Mods.

### Installing

Select Extensions from the sidebar to open the Extensions screen. Simply drag and drop the archive file into the drop zone at the bottom to install it. Finally click Enable on the extension to deploy the files, and restart Vortex.
