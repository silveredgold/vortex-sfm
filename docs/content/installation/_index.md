Installing SFM for Vortex is a simple process, but make sure to follow the instructions closely to prevent any issues with the extension later on.

Before we begin, make sure you have already installed both Vortex and SFM.

You can get the extension files from either [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/64) or [GitHub.](https://github.com/silveredgold/vortex-sfm).
