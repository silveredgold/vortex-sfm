Previous versions of SFM for Vortex were distributed as separate versions of the same extension to accomodate different install patterns. Since 0.1.0 the extension has been updated to use mod types (a feature in Vortex) to allow installing different mods to different locations with the same extension. 

If you were previously using the Alternate variant of SFM for Vortex, install the latest version of the extension and change the default install mode in the Mods tab of your Vortex settings to 'Isolated'. This reflects the same behaviour as the old Alternate version while allowing you to choose which mods install to which locations.
