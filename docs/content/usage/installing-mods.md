Now that Vortex is fully set up, download any mods you want to install. Mod files should be the original mod archive files (*.rar, *.zip, *.7z etc).

Open the **Mods** screen from the Vortex sidebar and drag-and-drop the archive files into Vortex to add them to your list. You will then need to install them and enable them as per the usual Vortex installation process.

Once you **Enable** a mod, its files will be installed into SFMâ€™s install directly automatically.
