This is just a community-backed open-source project, not an officially-supported Vortex component. As such, support is best-effort.

To report a problem or request a new feature, create a new issue on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/silveredgold/vortex-sfm/issues) and provide as much detail as possible.
