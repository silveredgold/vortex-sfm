  A basic introduction to SFM for Vortex
---
vortex-sfm is a Vortex extension that adds support for Source Filmmaker. This allows for managing (non-Workshop) mods and assets using the Vortex mod manager.

This simplifies installing SFM “mods” from external sources (SFMLab, other users, forums, DA etc) by automatically installing any mod from an archive file. It also means you can quickly and easily enable/disable or uninstall mods without affecting your other installed mods, all from Vortex’s convenient UI.

If you already use Vortex for games, this extension will not interfere with them and SFM will simply be available as a discovered game you can manage.
